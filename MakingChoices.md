# Making Choices 1
Using 'if' and 'else' to make decisions
```python
num = 37
if num > 100:
    print('greater')
else:
    print('not greater')
print('done')
```
    not greater
    done




```python
num = 53
print('before conditional...')
if num > 100:
    print(num, 'is greater than 100')
print('...after conditional')
```
    before conditional...
    ...after conditional




```python
num = -3

if num > 0:
    print(num, 'is positive')
elif num == 0:
    print(num, 'is zero')
else:
    print(num, 'is negative')
```
    -3 is negative




```python
if (1 > 0) and (-1 >= 0):
    print('both parts are true')
else:
    print('at least one part is false')
```
    at least one part is false




```python
if (1 > 0) or (-1 >= 0):
    print('at least one part is true')
else:
    print('both of these are false')
```
    at least one part is true
# Making Choices 2
Using 'if' 'else' and 'elif' to make decisions and applyication for reading a datafile.
```python
import numpy
```

```python
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter = ',')
```

```python
max_inflammation_0 = numpy.amax(data, axis =0)[0]
```

```python
max_inflammation_20 = numpy.amax(data, axis = 0)[20]

if max_inflammation_0 == 0 and max_inflammation_20 == 20:
    print('Suspictious looking maxima!')
elif numpy.sum(numpy.amin(data, axis = 0)) == 0:
    print('Minima add up to zero!')
else:
    print('Seems OK!')
```
    Suspictious looking maxima!




```python
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname = 'inflammation-03.csv', delimiter = ',')
max_inflammation_0 = numpy.amax(data, axis = 0)[0]
max_inflammation_20 = numpy.amax(data, axis = 0)[20]

if max_inflammation_0 == 0 and max_inflammation_20 == 20:
    print('Suspicious looking maxima!')
elif numpy.sum(numpy.amin(data, axis = 0)) == 0:
    print('Minima add up to zero -> HEALTHY PARTICIPANT ALERT!')
else:
    print('Seems OK!')
```
    Minima add up to zero -> HEALTHY PARTICIPANT ALERT!


```python

```
